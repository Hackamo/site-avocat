House arrest is an alternative to administrative detention. It allows you to remain free while being subject to certain obligations. Less known than detention, it nonetheless offers rights and possibilities for contestation. Here's everything you need to know.

## What is House Arrest?

House arrest is a measure requiring you to reside in a determined place (your home or another location) while awaiting your departure from French territory.

**Difference from Detention:**

- You remain free (you are not confined)
- You can live at home or designated location
- You must periodically report to police or gendarmerie

**Maximum Duration:** 6 months renewable, but rarely beyond several weeks to several months in practice.

## In What Cases Can You Be Placed Under House Arrest?

House arrest intervenes when:

1. **You are subject to a removal measure** (OQTF, expulsion, Schengen readmission)
2. **You cannot be placed in detention** because:
    - You present sufficient representation guarantees
    - You are parent of minor child residing in France
    - You are pregnant (from 2nd trimester)
    - You have health problems incompatible with detention
    - Detention centers are saturated

3. **You are released from a detention center** and must await departure

## House Arrest Conditions

### Designated Location

You can be placed under house arrest:

- **At your home**: the most frequent option
- **In hotel or hostel**: if you have no stable housing
- **In determined municipality**: you must stay within municipality limits

**Important:** the location must suit your personal situation (health, family, work if authorized).

### Obligations to Respect

The house arrest order specifies your obligations:

**Police or Gendarmerie Reporting:**

- Frequency: generally 1 to 3 times weekly (sometimes daily)
- Fixed hours: you must report at specific times
- Non-compliance consequences: detention placement, criminal proceedings

**Prohibitions:**

- Leaving house arrest location without authorization
- Leaving municipality (depending on cases)
- Missing convocations

**Possible Authorizations:**

- Medical outings (with justification)
- Family emergency outings (death, hospitalization)
- Administrative appointment outings (prefecture, consulate)

**Passport Surrender:**
In certain cases, you must surrender your passport to authorities to prevent flight risk.

## Your Rights During House Arrest

### Limited Freedom of Movement

You can freely circulate within house arrest limits (your home, municipality, etc.), except express prohibition.

### Right to Work

**In Principle:** you cannot work during house arrest linked to removal measure.

**Exceptions:**

- If you had work authorization before house arrest, it remains valid
- Possibility of requesting exceptional authorization if house arrest lasts long

### Right to Health

You maintain access to care:

- Universal health protection (PUMA) if eligible
- Medical State Aid (AME) if in irregular status for over 3 months

### Right to a Lawyer

You can consult a lawyer anytime and benefit from legal aid if your resources are insufficient.

### Right to Contest House Arrest

You can contest house arrest before the Judge of Freedoms and Detention or administrative court.

## Contestation Grounds

### 1. Absence of Flight Risk

If you present sufficient representation guarantees:

- Stable housing
- Family in France
- Regular work
- No history of non-appearance

**Argument:** house arrest unnecessary because you won't flee.

### 2. Disproportionate Conditions

If imposed obligations are too burdensome:

- Too frequent reporting (multiple daily)
- Impossible hours
- Inadequate arrest location (far from family, medical care)

**Argument:** house arrest infringes excessively on freedom.

### 3. Impossibility of Executing Removal Measure

If your removal is impossible or cannot be organized:

- Absence of travel documents
- Consulate refusal to issue travel document
- Impossibility of return to your country (war, persecutions, no reception)

**Argument:** house arrest lacks justification since you cannot be removed.

### 4. Personal and Family Situation

If house arrest excessively infringes on private and family life:

- Separation from your children
- Impossibility to follow medical treatment
- Inability to work to support family

**Argument:** violation of Article 8 of the ECHR (right to private and family life).

### 5. Procedural Defect

If house arrest order presents irregularities:

- Lack of motivation
- Absence of mention of recourse options
- Non-compliance with contradictory procedure

**Argument:** decision illegality.

## Possible Recourse

### 1. Recourse Before Judge of Freedoms and Detention (JLD)

If house arrest lasts beyond 48 hours, you must be presented to JLD to rule on its maintenance.

**Deadline:** hearing within 48 hours of house arrest pronouncement

**Judge's Role:**

- Control house arrest legality
- Verify conditions are proportionate
- Decide on maintenance or lifting

**Possible Outcomes:**

- House arrest lifting
- Maintenance with condition modification
- Maintenance as-is

**Advice:** have lawyer assist you for this crucial hearing.

### 2. Contentious Recourse Before Administrative Court

You can contest house arrest order before administrative court invoking:

- Illegality of underlying removal measure
- House arrest disproportionality
- Article 8 ECHR violation

**Deadline:** 48 hours for emergency referral, 2 months for full recourse

### 3. Request for Condition Modification

If house arrest conditions are too restrictive, you can request the prefecture modify them:

- Reduce reporting frequency
- Modify hours
- Change arrest location

**Procedure:** registered mail with acknowledgment to the prefect

## What to Do During House Arrest?

### 1. Scrupulously Respect Your Obligations

Any breach can result in:

- Detention placement
- Criminal proceedings (up to 3 years prison and €9,000 fine)

### 2. Contest the Removal Measure

House arrest is only a consequence of the removal measure (OQTF, expulsion). Attack the main measure to lift house arrest.

**Recourse to Initiate:**

- Gracious recourse
- Contentious recourse against OQTF or expulsion
- Request for exceptional admission to stay

### 3. Prepare Your Defense

Gather evidence of:

- Your integration in France
- Your family links
- Your impossibility to return to your country
- Your personal situation (health, work, family)

### 4. Remain in Contact with Your Lawyer

Inform him immediately of any difficulty:

- Impossible house arrest conditions
- Health problem
- Prefecture or police summons

### 5. Anticipate the Outcome

**If the removal measure is cancelled:**

- House arrest is lifted automatically
- You can request residence permit

**If the removal measure is upheld:**

- Explore exceptional admission to stay possibilities
- If removal is impossible, request provisional authorization for stay

## House Arrest vs Detention

| Criterion        | House Arrest             | Administrative Detention       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Freedom**      | Yes, under conditions    | No (confinement)               |
| **Location**     | Home or designated place | Detention center               |
| **Max Duration** | 6 months renewable       | 90 days (120 in certain cases) |
| **Obligations**  | Periodic reporting       | Permanent presence at center   |
| **Work**         | No (except exception)    | No                             |
| **Family**       | Possible shared life     | Limited visits                 |
| **Cost**         | None for you             | None for you                   |

**House Arrest Advantage:** you maintain quasi-normal life and can better prepare defense.

## Special Cases

### Parent of Minor Child

If you are parent of minor child residing in France, house arrest must be privileged over detention.

**Arguments to Invoke:**

- Child's best interests
- Necessity to maintain family link
- Measure proportionality

### Pregnant Woman

From 2nd trimester of pregnancy, you cannot be placed in detention. House arrest is therefore the only option.

### Ill Person

If your health is incompatible with detention, house arrest must be ordered.

**Documents to Provide:**

- Detailed medical certificates
- Specialist doctor attestations
- Evidence of necessary regular medical follow-up

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with house arrest is a **criminal offense** punished by:

- **3 years prison**
- **€9,000 fine**
- **Administrative detention placement**

**Aggravating Circumstances:**

- If you leave French territory: sentence aggravated
- If using fake documents: offense cumulation

**Advice:** strictly respect your obligations. In case of impossibility (illness, emergency), immediately notify authorities and your lawyer.

## Duration and End of House Arrest

### Initial Duration

House arrest is pronounced for determined duration (generally 1 to 3 months), renewable up to 6 months maximum.

### House Arrest End

House arrest ends when:

- **You are removed from territory** (effective expulsion)
- **The removal measure is cancelled** (by administrative court)
- **Maximum duration reached** (6 months)
- **Your situation changes** (residence permit obtainment)

**After Lifting:** if you aren't removed and removal measure remains valid, you are in irregular status and risk new detention or house arrest placement.

## Practical Tips

1. **Note precisely your obligations**: hours, locations, reporting frequency
2. **Keep all justifications**: police reporting certificates
3. **Anticipate difficulties**: prepare employer attestation if need professional absences
4. **Request authorizations**: for any necessary displacement (care, family)
5. **Prepare your defense**: contest removal measure in parallel

## Conclusion

House arrest is less restrictive than detention, but imposes significant constraints. Strictly respect your obligations while actively preparing defense against removal measure.

**Strategy to Adopt:**

1. Strictly respect house arrest (avoid detention)
2. Contest the removal measure (OQTF, expulsion)
3. Gather integration and France link evidence
4. Have specialized lawyer assist you
