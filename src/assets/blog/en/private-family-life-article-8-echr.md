Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is one of the most powerful tools for contesting a removal measure. Understanding how to invoke it can make the difference between success and failure. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Does Article 8 of the ECHR Say?

Article 8 of the ECHR provides that:

_"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence."_

This text protects your right to live as a family and maintain your personal links. It applies to all member states of the Council of Europe, including France.

## How Does It Apply in Immigration Law?

When the prefecture refuses a residence permit or issues a removal measure (OQTF, expulsion), it can infringe on your private and family life. Article 8 allows you to contest this decision before the judge.

**The Principle:** any interference with your private and family life must be:

1. **Provided by law** (the measure must have a clear legal basis)
2. **Necessary in a democratic society** (proportionate to a legitimate aim)
3. **Proportionate** (the infringement must not be excessive relative to the aim pursued)

## Criteria Examined by the Judge

To determine whether a measure imposes a disproportionate infringement on your private and family life, the judge examines several elements:

### 1. Seniority and Intensity of Links in France

- **Duration of stay**: how long have you been living in France?
- **Age of arrival**: did you arrive as a child or adult?
- **Integration**: do you participate in social, associative, professional life?
- **French proficiency**: do you speak and write fluently?

### 2. Family Links in France

- **Spouse**: are you married or in civil partnership with someone legally residing in France?
- **Children**: do you have French children or children residing in France? What is your role in their education?
- **Parents**: do your parents reside in France? Are you dependent on them or are they dependent on you?
- **Siblings**: do your siblings live in France?

### 3. Situation in Country of Origin

- **Links retained**: do you still have family in your country of origin?
- **Possibility of reinstatement**: could you reinstall in your country?
- **Personal situation**: are there risks for you if you return (persecutions, violence, illness)?

### 4. Personal Conduct

- **Respect for public order**: do you have criminal convictions?
- **Regularity of stay**: did you enter legally? Have you always respected the rules?
- **Good faith**: were you transparent in your procedures?

## Favorable Situations for Invoking Article 8

### Established Family Life in France

**Typical Example:** you are married to a French person, you have children in school in France, you have been living together for several years.

**Arguments to Develop:**

- Stability and seniority of the couple
- Active role in children's education
- Impossibility for your family to follow you to your country of origin
- Integration of children in France (school, friends, activities)

### Private Life Rooted in France

**Typical Example:** you have been living in France since childhood, completed all your studies there, no longer have links with your country of origin.

**Arguments to Develop:**

- Length of stay in France (generally more than 10-15 years)
- Education and training in France
- Social, friendly, and professional network exclusively in France
- Absence of real links with country of origin (language, culture, family)

### Health Reasons

**Typical Example:** you or a family member suffers from a pathology requiring care unavailable in your country of origin.

**Arguments to Develop:**

- Detailed medical certificates
- Specialist doctor attestations
- Proof of unavailable treatment in country of origin
- Impact of return on your or your relatives' health

## How to Effectively Invoke Article 8?

### 1. In Appeal Against Refusal of Residence Permit

Draft a memorandum developing:

- Your detailed personal and family situation
- Elements proving your integration
- The infringement constituted by the refusal to your private and family life
- The disproportionality between the measure and the aims pursued by the administration

### 2. In Appeal Against OQTF

Develop a specific argument on violation of Article 8:

- Set out all links in France (family, work, health)
- Demonstrate the impossibility or extreme difficulties of return
- Prove your good faith and integration
- Show that removal would have serious and irreversible consequences

### 3. In a Request for Exceptional Admission to Stay

Even if you are in irregular status, invoke Article 8 to request regularization:

- Length of presence (generally 10 years minimum)
- Impossibility of return to country of origin
- Exceptional integration (work, family, social integration)

## Evidence to Gather

To convince the judge, assemble a complete file:

**Family Life:**

- Marriage certificates, family record book, birth certificates
- School attendance certificates for children
- Family photos, testimony from friends and neighbors
- Proofs of shared life (leases, joint bills, joint bank statements)

**Private Life:**

- Address proofs over several years
- Pay stubs, employment contracts
- Association memberships, sports club memberships
- Diplomas obtained in France
- French language certificates

**Situation in Country of Origin:**

- Proofs of absence of family or links
- News articles showing insecurity or political situation
- NGO reports (Amnesty International, HRW)

## Mistakes to Avoid

### Not Documenting Sufficiently

An argument without evidence is ineffective. Each claim must be supported by a document.

### Neglecting the Legal Aspect

Article 8 is not simply a life narrative: it is a legal argument. You must demonstrate that the administrative measure is **disproportionate** relative to the legitimate aims pursued.

### Forgetting to Answer Refusal Reasons

If the prefecture invokes public order or bad faith reasons, answer them point by point.

## Recent Case Law

The European Court of Human Rights has recently reaffirmed that:

- States must consider the **best interests of the child** (Mugenzi v. France, 2020)
- Long presence in France, even irregular, can justify regularization (Udeh v. France, 2021)
- Impossibility for spouse to follow to country of origin is a determining element (Biao v. Denmark, 2016)

## Conclusion

Article 8 of the ECHR is a powerful tool for defending your rights regarding stay. Its invocation requires solid legal argumentation and a complete file. Faced with refusal of residence permit or removal measure, consult quickly a specialized lawyer to evaluate your chances and build effective defense.

**Important Reminder:** the simple fact of having private and family life in France is not enough. You must demonstrate that the administrative measure imposes a **disproportionate infringement** on these rights, which requires fine legal analysis of your situation.
