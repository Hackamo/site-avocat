Receiving a residence permit refusal is a difficult and stressful moment. But it's not necessarily the end: recourse options exist and can succeed. Here is the complete guide to knowing how to react and what options are available.

## Understanding the Refusal Decision

Before anything, read the decision carefully. It must obligatorily mention:

1. **The refusal reasons**: why is the prefecture refusing your application?
2. **The recourse options**: how and within what deadlines can you contest?
3. **The existence of an OQTF**: are you also subject to an obligation to leave the territory?

**Important:** if the decision doesn't mention the reasons or recourse options, it can be annulled for procedural defect.

## Most Common Refusal Reasons

### 1. Insufficient Resources

The prefecture considers your income too low to meet your needs.

**Possible Solution:**

- Supplement your file with new resource justifications
- Demonstrate that other people contribute to your maintenance
- Prove a temporary situation in improvement

### 2. Absence of Integration

French level or integration evidence are deemed insufficient.

**Possible Solution:**

- Obtain French certification (DELF/DALF)
- Gather integration attestations (associations, neighbors, employers)
- Demonstrate your participation in local life

### 3. Threat to Public Order

You have judicial antecedents or behavior deemed problematic.

**Possible Solution:**

- Demonstrate your reinstatement and behavior change
- Provide moral character attestations
- Explain the context of reproached facts
- Assert the seniority and minor nature of offenses

### 4. Lack of Justifications

Documents are missing or deemed non-compliant.

**Possible Solution:**

- Quickly supplement the file
- Explain reasons for absence of certain documents
- Provide equivalent or alternative documents

### 5. Suspicious Marital Status

The prefecture doubts the sincerity of your marriage or shared life.

**Possible Solution:**

- Provide additional shared life evidence
- Demonstrate the reality and sincerity of your relationship
- Provide testimony from close ones

## Different Types of Recourse

### 1. Gracious Recourse (Administrative)

A request addressed directly to the prefect for re-examination of your situation.

**Deadline:** 2 months from notification of refusal

**Advantages:**

- Free and simple
- Allows supplementing your file
- No court costs

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited success rate (approximately 10-15%)
- Absence of response after 2 months counts as implicit rejection

**Advice:** gracious recourse should not prevent preparing contentious recourse in parallel.

### 2. Contentious Recourse (Administrative Court)

An action before the administrative court to contest the legality of the decision.

**Deadline:** 2 months from notification of refusal (or response to gracious recourse)

**Advantages:**

- Higher success rate (approximately 30-40% depending on situations)
- The judge can cancel the decision and obligate the prefecture to re-examine your file
- You can be represented by a lawyer

**Disadvantages:**

- Longer procedure (6 to 18 months)
- Need for solid legal argumentation
- Lawyer costs (but legal aid possible)

### 3. Suspension Referral

An emergency procedure to suspend execution of the decision while awaiting judgment on the merits.

**Deadline:** file at the same time as contentious recourse

**Conditions:**

- Urgency: you risk imminent execution of the measure
- Serious doubt: the decision appears illegal

**Advantages:**

- Quick decision (several weeks)
- Suspends the OQTF if applicable

**Disadvantages:**

- Low success rate (approximately 20%)
- Doesn't resolve the merits of your file

## Strategy to Adopt According to Your Situation

### Situation 1: You Can Easily Supplement Your File

**Recommendation:** gracious recourse + contentious recourse preparation

Take advantage of gracious recourse to:

- Provide missing documents
- Correct initial file errors
- Better explain your situation

If gracious recourse fails, you'll have 2 additional months to appeal to the administrative court.

### Situation 2: Refusal is Manifestly Illegal

**Recommendation:** immediate contentious recourse + suspension referral if OQTF

If the decision presents obvious form or substantive defects:

- Lack of motivation
- Legal error
- Manifest error of assessment
- Violation of Article 8 of the ECHR

Appeal directly to the administrative court with a lawyer's help.

### Situation 3: You Are Subject to an OQTF

**Recommendation:** urgent contentious recourse + suspension referral

Don't waste time: you risk expulsion. Immediately consult a lawyer to:

- Contest the OQTF within deadlines (30 days, sometimes less)
- File a suspension referral to prevent removal
- Prepare solid defense

### Situation 4: Your Situation Has Changed

**Recommendation:** new application + possibly gracious recourse

If your situation has changed since the refusal:

- New employment contract
- Resource improvement
- Diploma or French certificate obtained
- Birth of a child

You can file a new residence permit application while contesting the previous decision.

## Legal Arguments to Develop

To maximize your chances, invoke several legal arguments:

### 1. Procedural Defects

- Insufficiently motivated decision
- Absence of mention of recourse options
- Lack of prior consultation (for certain titles)
- Irregular notification

### 2. Legal Error

- Incorrect application of law
- Non-applicable law applied to your situation
- Non-application of a favorable provision

### 3. Manifest Error of Assessment

- Non-consideration of important documents

### 4. Violation of Article 8 of the ECHR

- Disproportionate infringement on your private and family life
- Non-consideration of child's best interests
- Impossibility of return to country of origin
