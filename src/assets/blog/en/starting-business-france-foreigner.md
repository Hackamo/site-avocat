2. File bylaws
3. Publish legal notice
4. Register business at RCS (Business Register) or RM (Trades Register)
5. Obtain KBIS (registration extract)

**Deadline:** approximately 2 to 4 weeks

### Step 4: File Residence Permit Application

Once business is created, apply at the prefecture.

**Specific Documents:**

## Special Cases

### You Are a Student

If you have a student residence permit, you cannot directly create a business. You must:

1. Complete your studies
2. Request APS (Provisional Authorization for Stay) to create business (12 months)
3. During APS, create your business and prepare file
4. Request status change to "entrepreneur"

### You Are an Employee

If you have employee residence permit, you can request status change to "entrepreneur".

**Condition:** your business must be distinct from current employment (no competition).

### You Are in Irregular Status

In principle, you cannot request this title. But if:

- You created a flourishing business in France for several years
- You employ staff
- Your activity is significant for local economy

You can attempt **exceptional admission to stay** as entrepreneur.

## Regulated Activities

Some professions require specific qualifications or authorizations:

### Regulated Liberal Professions

- Lawyer, doctor, architect, accountant: French diploma or equivalence required
- Professional order registration necessary

### Craft Activities

- Hairdresser, electrician, plumber: CAP or 3 years professional experience minimum
- Chamber of Trades registration

### Food Commerce

- Food hygiene training (HACCP)
- Health authorization for certain activities

**Verify** your sector requirements before starting. The prefecture will refuse your application if you don't meet professional conditions.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Unrealistic Business Plan

Avoid overly optimistic forecasts. The prefecture prefers modest but realistic project.

### 2. Absence of Financial Means

You must prove you can live during business startup (6 to 12 months without revenue).

### 3. Too Vague Project

Be precise: name your suppliers, potential customers, commercial premises.

### 4. Not Anticipating Renewals

Plan from start rigorous financial monitoring to facilitate renewals.

### 5. Neglecting Tax and Social Obligations

Any delay in declarations or payments can result in renewal refusal.

## Financing Your Project

### Public Assistance

- **ACCRE (ACRE)**: social charge exemption first year
- **Honor Loan**: interest-free loan without guarantee (Réseau Entreprendre, Initiative France)
- **Local Subsidies**: by regions and sectors

### Private Financing

- **Bank Loan**: difficult without guarantee or France experience
- **Love Money**: loans from family or close ones
- **Business Angels**: private investors for innovative projects
- **Crowdfunding**: participatory financing

**Advice:** prioritize significant personal contribution (at least 30% of total need) to reassure prefecture and banks.

If you obtain "entrepreneur" or "talent passport" title, your spouse and minor children can join you via **family reunification** or specific residence permits.

**Advantages:**

- Your spouse obtains automatic work authorization
- Simplified procedure
- Shorter deadlines than classic family reunification
