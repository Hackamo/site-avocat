## 🏛️ Immigration Law — 7 Victories

### 1. Employment Residence Permit Obtained for an Occupation in Shortage

**📌 The Situation:**

A foreign national present in France for several years was refused an employment residence permit twice with an obligation to leave the territory. He worked in an occupation classified as shortage in the region according to the current ministerial order, with several years of continuous professional experience.

**⚠️ The Legal Issue:**

The prefect invoked the absence of a residence permit and a past administrative procedure. However, the applicant demonstrated significant professional experience in an occupation in shortage, a firm employment promise, and a work authorization request in progress.

**🎯 Our Strategy Before the Administrative Court:**

We demonstrated the prefect's manifest error of assessment:

- Documented professional experience: pay stubs over several years, professional certifications, professional card, work certificates
- Confirmed occupation in shortage: profession listed in the ministerial order for the region
- Genuine employment promise: permanent contract offered with employer attestation of recruitment difficulties
- Successful integration: long-standing presence in France, French language proficiency, absence of recent antecedents
- Rare skills: specialized expertise difficult to find on the labor market

**✅ Result Obtained:**

The Administrative Court cancelled the refusal of residence permit and ordered the prefect to issue an employment residence permit within 2 months.

**⚖️ Legal Basis:**

Articles L. 435-1 and L. 435-4 of the CESEDA (exceptional admission to stay). The judge considered that the prefect could not oppose conditions of regularity of stay given that the conditions for professional integration in an occupation in shortage were met.

**💡 Practical Advice:**

If you work in an occupation in shortage (list available on service-public.fr), build a solid file: all your pay stubs, work certificates, employment promise, professional training evidence, and employer attestation of recruitment difficulties. Length of presence and absence of antecedents are determining factors.

### 2. "Private and Family Life" Title for a Mother of Schoolchildren

### 3. Suspension by Referral of Refusal to Renew Residence Permit

### 4. Long-stay Employment Visa for a Restaurant Professional

### 5. Cancellation of Naturalization Deferral

### 6. Maintenance of "Private and Family Life" Title After Divorce

### 7. "Parent of French Child" Title Obtained

## ⚖️ Criminal Law — 2 Victories

### 8. Home Detention Under Electronic Monitoring Obtained Quickly

**📌 The Situation:**

A person sentenced to a prison term requested an amendment while having served only a limited fraction of the custodial sentence imposed.

**🎯 Our Strategy Before the Judge of Sentence Enforcement:**

- Progress in detention: good conduct, increased awareness
- Stable accommodation: with a family member
- Concrete professional project: firm employment promise
- Medical follow-up: scheduled appointments
- Voluntary victim compensation
- Absence of dangerousness

**✅ Result Obtained:**

The Judge of Sentence Enforcement granted home detention under electronic monitoring, enabling rapid release.

**⚖️ Legal Basis:**

Articles 723-7 and D 535 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Electronic home detention can be granted when the remaining sentence does not exceed 2 years. Speed depends on project quality.

**💡 Practical Advice:**

To obtain electronic home detention quickly: detailed accommodation attestation, employment promise, medical follow-up, voluntary victim compensation, testimonials from close ones. Early application is not an obstacle if the project is solid.
