Living as a couple with a French person opens specific rights regarding stay in France. Whether you are married, in civil partnership, or cohabiting, each situation has its own rules and conditions. Here is the complete 2026 guide.

## Marriage with a French Person

Marriage with a French national is the most protective situation in immigration law.

### Obtaining a First Residence Permit

After your marriage, you can request a **temporary residence card "private and family life"** valid for one year.

**Conditions to Fulfill:**

- Being married civilly (religious marriage not recognized)
- Effective shared life
- Regular entry to France (long-stay visa or exemption)

**Documents to Provide:**

- Marriage certificate with transcript to French civil registry
- Shared life justifications (lease, bills, attestations)
- Regular entry justification (visa, stamped passport)
- Couple's resource justifications
- Identity photos

**Visa Exemption:**
Some nationals can request residence permit directly in France without having entered with long-stay visa:

- Algerian nationals
- People who entered as minors in France
- Parents of French child
- Exceptional situations (impossibility to return to country of origin)

### Resident Card (10-year Title)

After **3 years of marriage** (1 year if you have a French child together), you can request a **resident card** for 10 years.

**Additional Conditions:**

- Uninterrupted shared life
- Republican integration (A2 French level and respect for Republic values)
- No threat to public order

**Advantages:**

- Title valid 10 years renewable
- Enhanced protection against removal
- No need to justify resources at renewal

### Shared Life Breakdown

**Warning:** if you separate or divorce within 4 years of your arrival in France, you may lose your residence permit.

**Exceptions (Right to Stay Maintained):**

- Proven domestic violence
- Death of French spouse
- French child for whom you have custody or contribute to maintenance
- Particularly intense private and family roots in France

### Suspicion of Sham Marriage

The prefecture can refuse or revoke your title if it suspects a white or gray marriage.

**Raised Indicators:**

- Absence of actual shared life
- Significant age difference
- Mutual ignorance
- Absence of shared project
- Recent marriage after an OQTF

**How to Prove Marriage Sincerity:**

- Photos of couple over several years
- Testimony from close ones
- Shared projects (property purchase, joint account)
- Correspondence, messages
- Participation in family life

**In Case of Doubt:** the prefecture can summon you for separate interview with your spouse. Prepare well and have yourself accompanied by a lawyer.

## Civil Partnership with a French Person

Civil Partnership (PACS) also offers rights, but less extensive than marriage.

### Conditions

- PACS registered in France
- Effective shared life for at least **1 year**
- Real and continuous community of life

### Residence Permit

You can obtain a **temporary residence card "private and family life"** for one year, renewable.

**Difference from Marriage:**

- No automatic access to 10-year resident card
- Less protection in case of PACS breakdown
- More documents needed to prove shared life

**Additional Documents to Prepare:**

- PACS registration attestation
- Shared life evidence for at least 1 year (leases, bills, bank statements)
- Testimony from close ones
- Photos, evidence of shared trips

### Evolution Toward Resident Card

After several years of renewal (generally 5 years of regular stay in France), you can request resident card via general law.

## Cohabitation with a French Person

Cohabitation (free union) gives **no automatic right** to stay. However, it can be considered in certain situations.

### Exceptional Admission to Stay

If you live in stable and long-standing cohabitation with a French person, you can request regularization via **exceptional admission to stay**.

**Conditions:**

- Proven shared life over several years (generally 5 years minimum)
- Stability of relationship
- Integration in France (work, social ties)
- Impossibility to marry or enter PACS (valid reason)

**Evidence to Provide:**

- Shared life attestations over several years
- Detailed testimonials
- Professional and social integration evidence
- Resource justifications

### Parent of French Child

If you have a French child with your cohabitant, you can obtain residence permit **without proving shared life** with the French parent.

**Conditions:**

- Establishment of paternity/maternity
- Effective contribution to child's maintenance and education since birth or for at least 2 years

## Effective Shared Life: How to Prove It?

The prefecture is very attentive to couple reality. Here are elements to gather:

### Common Residence

- Lease in both names
- Utility bills (electricity, water, gas, internet) in both names
- Common home insurance certificates
- Address certificates

### Financial Community

- Joint bank account
- Bank statements showing shared expenses
- Credits contracted together
- Joint tax returns (couple filing)

### Common Social Life

- Photos together over several years
- Invitations to family events
- Testimony from friends and neighbors
- Participation in shared activities

### Family Project

- Marriage or PACS project
- Real estate purchase project
- Child project or presence of shared children
- Common professional project

**Advice:** keep all justifications since relationship start. The fuller your file, the better.

## Entry and Regular Stay: The Visa Question

### If You Are Abroad

To join your French spouse in France, you must request a **long-stay "spouse of French" visa** from the French consulate in your country.

**Procedure:**

1. Marriage in your country or France (your spouse comes to marry you)
2. Marriage transcript to French civil registry
3. Visa application to consulate
4. Instruction (2 to 6 months depending on countries)
5. Visa issuance worth residence permit (VLS-TS)

**Once in France:**

- Validate visa with OFII within 3 months
- Obtain residence permit after 1 year

### If You Are Already in France

**In Regular Status** (tourism visa, student title, etc.):
You can request status change or first residence permit directly at prefecture without returning to your country.

**In Irregular Status:**
In principle, you must return to your country to request visa. However, exceptions exist:

- Long-standing marriage (several years)
- Long-standing presence in France (10 years or more)
- French child
- Impossibility of return (refugee, stateless, country risk)

**Advice:** don't marry in emergency to avoid OQTF. Preference is sincere and long-standing relationship.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Marrying Too Quickly After OQTF

This strengthens suspicions of sham marriage. Prefer sincere and long-standing relationship.

### Neglecting Shared Life Evidence

Without solid justifications, your application will be refused. Anticipate and keep all documents.

### Lying About Your Situation

The prefecture can verify your statements. Any fraud can result in definitive refusal and territory ban.

### Not Preparing Prefecture Interview

If summoned, prepare well: the officer will test relationship sincerity with precise questions.

## Specific Protections

### In Case of Domestic Violence

If you are victim of violence from your French spouse, you can keep your residence permit even if separated.

**Evidence to Provide:**

- Police report filing
- Medical certificates
- Protective order from family court
- Testimony from close ones
- Report record

**Residence Permit:** you can obtain or keep "private and family life" card despite shared life breakdown.

### In Case of Spouse's Death

If your spouse dies, you keep your right to stay if you held a residence permit on that date.

## Toward Naturalization

Being married to a French person allows you to request French nationality via **declaration** (not naturalization) after:

- **4 years of marriage** in principle
- **3 years of marriage** if you justify continuous residence in France for at least 3 years after marriage

**Advantages:**

- Faster procedure than naturalization
- No duration of stay condition in France (with exception)
- Lower costs

## Practical Advice

1. **Document your relationship from the start**: photos, messages, trip tickets together
2. **Quickly have your marriage transcribed** to French civil registry
3. **Prepare a complete file** for the prefecture from first application
4. **Consult a lawyer** in complex situations (irregularity, marriage doubt, etc.)
5. **Anticipate deadlines**: expect 4 to 12 months for first title

## Conclusion

Living as a couple with a French person offers solid stay rights, provided you prove relationship reality and sincerity. Marriage remains the most protective situation, but civil partnership and even cohabitation can, under conditions, allow you to obtain residence permit.

The key to success: a sincere relationship, well-documented, and a complete file. In case of doubt or complex situation, don't hesitate to consult a lawyer specialized in immigration law to maximize your chances of obtaining your residence permit.
