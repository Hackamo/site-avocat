Being placed in an administrative detention center (CRA) is an urgent situation requiring quick reaction. Your rights are regulated and you have recourse to contest this measure. Here's what you absolutely need to know.

## What is an Administrative Detention Center?

The CRA is a place where the administration can place you while awaiting your removal from French territory. It is **not a prison**: you are not criminally condemned, but placed while awaiting expulsion.

**Maximum Duration:**

- 90 days maximum in mainland France
- 120 days in certain cases (threat to public order, flight, obstacle to removal)

## In What Cases Can You Be Placed in Detention?

Detention placement is only possible if:

1. You are subject to a **removal measure** (OQTF, expulsion, Schengen readmission)
2. You do not voluntarily present yourself for removal
3. You present a **flight risk** (no stable housing, no representation guarantees)

**Important:** detention placement is a last resort measure. If house arrest is possible, it must be preferred.

## Your Rights in Detention Center

Upon arrival at the CRA, you benefit from fundamental rights:

### 1. Right to Information

You must be informed:

- Of reasons for your placement
- Of expected duration of your detention
- Of your rights and recourse options
- In a language you understand

**In Practice:** a multilingual information notice must be given to you upon arrival.

### 2. Right to a Lawyer

You can:

- Request a court-appointed lawyer (free of charge)
- Choose your own lawyer
- Receive visits from your lawyer at any time
- Communicate freely with him

**Crucial:** have yourself assisted by a lawyer from the start. He can contest your placement and prepare your defense.

### 3. Right to an Interpreter

If you don't speak French, you have the right to:

- An interpreter at hearings before the judge
- Translation of essential documents
- Language assistance for your procedures

### 4. Right to Notify Close Ones

You can:

- Contact your family (a person of your choice)
- Notify your consulate
- Receive visits according to CRA hours

### 5. Right to Health

You benefit from:

- Medical examination within 24 hours of arrival
- Access to care if needed
- Management of existing pathologies
- Medical confidentiality

### 6. Other Rights

- Access to associations (La Cimade, France Terre d'Asile)
- Possibility to practice your religion
- Access to activities (television, telephone, mail)
- Food adapted to your religious convictions

## Recourse Against Detention Placement

You have **48 hours** to contest your placement before the Judge of Freedoms and Detention (JLD). This deadline is strict.

### Hearing Before JLD (48h)

**Automatic:** you will be presented to the Judge of Freedoms and Detention (JLD) within 48 hours following your placement.

**Judge's Role:**

- Verify legality of your placement
- Control that conditions are met (removal measure, flight risk)
- Rule on detention maintenance or release

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Immediate release**: if placement is irregular
- **House arrest**: less restrictive alternative
- **Detention maintenance**: for maximum determined duration

**Advice:** prepare this hearing well with your lawyer. It's your main chance to be released quickly.

### Arguments for Contesting

Your lawyer can invoke:

**1. Procedural Defects**

- Irregular notification of decision
- Absence of interpreter during your hearing
- Failure to inform you of your rights

**2. Absence of Flight Risk**

- You have stable housing
- You have family ties in France
- You always presented yourself to convocations

**3. Available Alternative**

- House arrest is sufficient
- You present representation guarantees
- Your personal situation justifies less coercive measure

**4. Illegality of the Removal Measure**

- The OQTF or expulsion order can be contested in parallel
- Violation of your right to respect private and family life (Article 8 ECHR)

### 20-Day Control (Extension)

If you haven't been removed within the first 20 days, the administration must request JLD extension.

**New Hearing:** you appear again before the judge who examines:

- Diligence accomplished to organize your departure
- Obstacles encountered
- Necessity to maintain detention

**Possible Outcomes:**

- Extension refused: you are released
- Extension granted: you remain in detention (up to 90 days maximum)

## Living Conditions in CRA

### Housing

- Single or collective rooms depending on centers
- Bed, blanket, hygiene products provided
- 24/24 access to restrooms

### Meals

- Three meals daily
- Religious or medical dietary requirements accommodated

### Activities

- Access to outdoor courtyard
- Television, games, library
- Telephone (calling card provided free)

### Visits

- Family and close ones allowed according to hours
- Lawyers any time
- Associations permanently present

**Important:** conditions vary by CRA. Some are more run-down or overcrowded than others.

## What to Do If Detention Is Extended?

If you aren't removed within planned deadlines:

### Verify Administration's Diligence

The administration must prove it's doing everything to organize your departure:

- Contacts with your consulate
- Flight booking
- Steps to obtain travel documents

**If administration does nothing**: your lawyer can request release for lack of diligence.

### Monitor Deadlines

- **20 days**: first extension possible
- **40 days**: second extension possible (only in certain cases)
- **90 days**: absolute maximum duration

**At deadline end**: you must be released, even if removal couldn't be organized.

## Special Cases

### You Are Parent of French Child

Detention is harder to justify. Invoke:

- Best interests of your child
- Your role in their education
- Violation of Article 8 of the ECHR

### You Have Health Problems

If your health is incompatible with detention:

- Request urgent medical examination
- Have your condition documented by CRA doctor
- Your lawyer can request release for medical reasons

### You Are Victim of Human Trafficking

You shouldn't be placed in detention. Report your situation:

- To associations present at CRA
- To your lawyer
- To the judge at hearing

### You Are a Minor

**In Principle**, minors cannot be placed in detention. If you are by mistake:

- Immediately report your age
- Request bone age test if necessary
- Demand your release and care by Child Social Services

## After Release

If released from CRA:

1. **Without cancellation of removal measure**: you remain under OQTF or expulsion, but free
2. **With cancellation**: if judge also cancelled your OQTF, you can request residence permit

**Advice:** quickly consult a lawyer to:

- Contest the removal measure if not yet done
- Request residence permit if your situation allows
- Avoid new detention placement

## Mistakes Not to Make

### Not Requesting a Lawyer

This is the gravest mistake. Without a lawyer, your release chances are nearly zero.

### Signing Documents You Don't Understand

Never sign a document you don't understand. Request an interpreter and clear explanation.

### Not Contesting the Removal Measure

Contesting detention placement alone isn't enough. You must also attack the OQTF or expulsion order.

### Accepting "Voluntary Return" Under Pressure

You may be offered voluntary return assistance. Think carefully: is this return really in your interest? Consult your lawyer before deciding.

### Not Reporting a Health Problem

If you're ill, report it immediately. Serious health conditions can justify release.

## Useful Statistics

- **JLD Release Rate**: approximately 25-30% of cases
- **Average Detention Duration**: 15 to 20 days
- **Effective Removal Rate**: approximately 50% of people detained

**Conclusion:** even in detention, you're not without recourse. Active and quick defense considerably increases your release chances.

## Useful Contacts

- **La Cimade**: association present in all CRAs, legal permanent offices
- **Court-appointed lawyers**: request the list from CRA administration
- **Consulate**: contact your diplomatic representation
- **Bar Association**: telephone helpline for legal assistance

## Conclusion

Detention placement is a serious measure infringing on your freedom. But you have effective rights and recourse. The key is reacting quickly:

1. **Immediately request a lawyer**
2. **Carefully prepare the 48-hour hearing**
3. **Contest all procedural defects**
4. **Invoke your personal and family situation**
5. **Stay in contact with associations**

Don't give up: many people obtain release through solid and reactive defense. Assert your rights with a specialized lawyer's help.
