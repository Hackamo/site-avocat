Receiving an obligation to leave French territory (OQTF) is a difficult and stressful moment. But be careful: in the rush and anxiety, many people make mistakes that can permanently compromise their chances of staying in France. Here are the 5 most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Not Respecting Appeal Deadlines

This is the most serious mistake and unfortunately the most common. You have **30 days** from the notification of the OQTF to file a contentious appeal before the administrative court. This deadline is strict and no extension is possible.

**What to do?** Upon receipt of the OQTF, immediately note the deadline for appeal and consult a lawyer as soon as possible. Don't waste time trying to understand the decision alone: every day counts.

_Good to know: if the OQTF is accompanied by a ban on re-entry to French territory (IRTF) or an obligation to leave without delay, appeal deadlines may be even shorter (48 hours for an emergency referral)._

## Mistake #2: Contesting Without Solid Legal Arguments

Many people think that simply explaining their personal situation is enough to obtain cancellation of the OQTF. However, the administrative court only rules on the legality of the administrative decision, not its appropriateness.

**Good legal arguments include:**

- Procedural defects (irregular notification, insufficient motivation)
- Legal error (incorrect application of the law)
- Manifest error of assessment (administration did not consider all file elements)
- Violation of right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 of the ECHR)
- Disproportionate infringement on competing interests

_Advice: a specialized lawyer will identify relevant legal arguments for your situation and draft a reasoned and convincing appeal._

## Mistake #3: Neglecting the Suspension Referral

The classic contentious appeal (excess of power claim) often takes several months before being judged. During this time, the OQTF remains executable and you can be expelled at any time.

**The Solution:** file in parallel a **suspension referral** which allows you to ask the judge of referrals to suspend execution of the OQTF while awaiting judgment on the merits. To obtain this suspension, you must demonstrate two cumulative conditions:

- Urgency (imminent expulsion risk, serious and irreversible consequences)
- Serious doubt about the legality of the decision

_Caution: the suspension referral must be filed at the same time as the main appeal. A lawyer can help you quickly assemble a convincing file._

## Mistake #4: Not Gathering Evidence of Your Situation

Even though the appeal is primarily legal, it is essential to prove your personal and family situation to demonstrate that the decision imposes a disproportionate infringement on your private and family life.

**Indispensable Documents:**

- School attendance certificates for your children
- Proof of residence establishing your territorial roots
- Employer attestations or employment promises
- Medical certificates if you or a family member have health issues
- Attestations from close ones (friends, neighbors, associations) testifying to your integration
- Proof of family links in France (birth certificates, family record book)

_Advice: the more complete and documented your file, the higher your chances of success. Don't settle for the bare minimum._

## Mistake #5: Remaining in France Without a Residence Permit After a Definitive OQTF

If your appeal is rejected and the OQTF becomes definitive, remaining in France in irregular status is a very bad strategy. Not only do you risk expulsion at any time, but you compromise your chances of future regularization.

**What to do if your appeal is rejected?**

- Examine with your lawyer the possibilities of appeal (appeal, cassation)
- File a new residence permit application if your situation has evolved (new job, birth of a child, marriage)
- If you must leave the territory, prepare your departure and inquire about possibilities for legal return

_Good to know: voluntary return assistance may be offered to you by OFII to facilitate your relocation to your country of origin._

## Summary: Good Reflexes When Facing an OQTF

1. Immediately consult a specialized lawyer
2. Strictly respect appeal deadlines
3. Gather all documents proving your situation
4. File a contentious appeal and, if necessary, a suspension referral
5. Do not remain in France in irregular status after a definitive decision
