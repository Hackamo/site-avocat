## Procedure Step by Step

### Step 1: Get the File

Download form CERFA n°11436\*05 or pick it up at the prefecture.

### Step 2: Constitute the File

Gather all required documents:

**On Your Situation:**

- Complete copy of your residence permit
- Proof of resources for the last 12 months
- Property lease or ownership title for your housing
- French language level attestation (DELF A2 or equivalent)

**On Your Family:**

- Marriage certificate (with certified translation if necessary)

- Compliant identity photos

**Other Documents:**

- Address proofs
- Tax return
- Health insurance attestation

### Step 3: File Application with OFII

Send your complete file by **registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt** to your region's OFII territorial office.

**Cost:** approximately €300 in taxes and fiscal stamps.

### Step 4: OFII Agent Visit

An agent will schedule an appointment with you to:

- Verify housing conditions
- Assess your personal situation
- Draft a report for the prefecture

**Advice:** prepare well for this visit; it is determining.

### Step 5: Prefecture Instruction

The prefecture examines your file and decides on your application.

**Legal Deadline:** 6 months maximum from complete file submission.

**Possible Outcome:**

- **Agreement**: issuance of long-stay visa application filing certificate for your family
- **Refusal**: mandatory motivation with recourse options

### Step 6: Your Family's Procedures

In case of agreement, your loved ones must:

1. Apply for long-stay "family reunification" visa at the French consulate
2. Pass medical examination
3. Obtain visa and enter France within 3 months

### Step 7: Arrival in France

Upon arrival, your family must:

- Register with OFII within 3 months
- Pass mandatory medical examination
- Obtain residence permit (temporary residence card for 1 year)

## Special Cases

### Family Reunification for Refugees

Conditions are relaxed:

- No resource condition
- No duration of stay condition required
- Accelerated procedure
- Ability to bring children up to age 19

### Children Born Abroad After Your Arrival in France

If your child is born abroad while you are already in France, you can request family reunification even if born after your installation.

### Family Already Present in France

If your family is already in France (with tourist visa for example), you cannot regularize on-site. They must return to country of origin and await family reunification agreement.

**Exception:** in exceptional circumstances (serious illness, impossibility of return), on-site regularization may be considered.

## Most Common Refusal Reasons

### 1. Insufficient or Unstable Resources

Income doesn't cover the entire 12-month period or is deemed too low.

### 2. Unsuitable Housing

Insufficient surface, insalubrity, or non-compliant lease.

### 3. Missing or Non-Compliant Documents

Incomplete state civil documents, non-certified translations, outdated documents.

### 4. Doubt About Family Link Reality

Suspected fraudulent marriage, inconsistencies in statements.

### 5. Threat to Public Order

Criminal convictions, behavior incompatible with Republican values.

## What to Do in Case of Refusal?

A refusal can be contested:

1. **Gracious recourse**: ask the prefect to re-examine the file (2 months)
2. **Contentious recourse**: appeal to the administrative court (2 months)
3. **New application**: if situation has positively evolved

**Advice:** in case of refusal, quickly consult a specialized lawyer to analyze reasons and determine best strategy.

## Average Deadlines

- File constitution: 1 to 2 months
- OFII instruction: 2 to 3 months
- Prefecture decision: 6 months maximum (often 4-5 months)
- Visa obtainment: 2 to 3 months
- **Total**: 9 to 12 months on average

**Advice:** anticipate as much as possible and carefully prepare your file to avoid additional delays.

## Rights of Your Family After Arrival

Once in France, your spouse and children obtain:

- **Residence Permit**: temporary residence card for 1 year "private and family life"
- **Right to Work**: your spouse can work without prior authorization
- **Renewal**: possible under conditions of shared life maintenance
- **Resident Card Access**: after 3 to 5 years of regular stay

## Practical Tips to Maximize Your Chances

1. **Anticipate**: start assembling your file 3-4 months before reaching 18 months of stay
2. **Be Rigorous**: verify all documents are complete, translated, and certified
3. **Stabilize Resources**: avoid job changes during file constitution
4. **Care for Housing**: ensure it complies with all standards before the visit
5. **Prepare Yourself**: obtain your French certification in advance
6. **Stay Reachable**: OFII and prefecture may request additional documents

## Conclusion

Family reunification is a demanding but accessible procedure if all conditions are met. Meticulous preparation and a complete file are the keys to success. Don't hesitate to consult a lawyer specialized in immigration law to assist you in this important procedure for your family.

**Important Reminder:** family reunification is a right under conditions. If you meet all legal conditions, the prefecture cannot refuse you this right without legitimate reason.
