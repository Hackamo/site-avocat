# Naturalization Refused for Administrative Error: How to React?

## Introduction

You filed a naturalization application and just received a refusal or deferral decision? This situation is particularly difficult to experience after years of presence in France and integration efforts. Yet in many cases, the refusal is due to an administrative error or contestable assessment of your file.

Master Martinet explains how to react effectively and assists you in your appeal procedures.

## 📋 Understanding Refusal Reasons

### Main Refusal Reasons

The prefecture and Ministry of Interior can refuse a naturalization application for several reasons:

#### 1. Lack of Integration

Integration is one of the fundamental criteria for naturalization. It includes:

- **French language proficiency** (B1 oral level minimum)
- **Knowledge of French citizen rights and duties**
- **Adherence to values of the Republic**

A refusal for lack of integration can be contested if you prove you meet these conditions.

#### 2. Unworthiness

Unworthiness concerns individuals who have committed criminal offenses, even old ones. However, not all convictions are prohibitive, and some can be expunged from criminal record after a certain period.

#### 3. Lack of Professional Integration

If you don't justify sufficient resources or are unemployed, the administration may determine that your professional integration is incomplete. This reason can be contested if your financial situation is temporary.

#### 4. Absence of Lasting Link with France

The administration verifies that you have established your life in France: stable housing, family, professional activity, participation in community life. If these elements are insufficient, naturalization may be refused.

## ⚠️ Common Administrative Errors

### Errors in File Assessment

#### Underestimation of French Level

It sometimes happens that the administration considers your French level insufficient when you have provided a diploma or B1 level attestation. In this case, it is possible to contest the decision by providing additional evidence.

#### Non-consideration of Justifications

Some essential documents may be wrongly dismissed: diplomas, training attestations, integration evidence. If your file contained these elements, the refusal can be contested.

#### Error Regarding Judicial Records

An old conviction, expunged from the second copy of the criminal record, should not be grounds for refusal. If the administration relies on a conviction that should no longer be opposable, an appeal is necessary.

### Procedural Defects

#### Insufficient Motivation

The refusal decision must be precisely motivated. If the reasons invoked are vague or general, the decision can be annulled for lack of motivation.

#### Abnormal Instruction Delay

If your file remained without response for an excessive period (more than 18 months), you can appeal to the administrative court to assert your rights.

## 🎯 Possible Recourse

### Gracious Recourse

Gracious recourse consists of asking the Ministry of Interior to re-examine your file. This recourse must be filed within **2 months** of notification of the refusal.

**Advantages:**

- Simple and fast procedure
- Opportunity to supplement the file with new justifications
- No court costs

**Disadvantages:**

- No guarantee of success
- Variable response time

### Contentious Recourse

Contentious recourse consists of appealing to the **administrative court** to request cancellation of the refusal decision. This recourse must also be filed within **2 months**.

**Advantages:**

- Judicial control of the decision
- Possibility of obtaining cancellation of the refusal and compelling administration to re-examine the file
- Right to legal aid if your resources are insufficient

**Disadvantages:**

- Longer procedure (12 to 24 months)
- Need to establish a solid legal file

### Recourse After Deferral

If your application was **deferred** (not refused), you can file a new application after a period of **2 years**. However, it is essential to correct the points that justified the deferral.

## ✅ How to Maximize Your Chances of Success?

### Precisely Analyze Refusal Reasons

Before any action, it is essential to understand exactly why your application was refused. A lawyer specialized in nationality law can help you decipher the decision and identify flaws in the administration's arguments.

### Gather Additional Evidence

If the refusal is based on contestable assessment, you must provide new elements:

- New French language level attestations
- Professional integration justifications
- Evidence of participation in local life (volunteering, associations)
- Attestations from honorably known persons

### Draft an Argued Memorandum

Whether for gracious or contentious recourse, it is essential to draft a solid memorandum that responds point by point to refusal reasons. This memorandum must be legally founded and supported by justifying documents.

### Respect Deadlines

Appeal deadlines are very strict. Any application filed outside deadlines will be inadmissible. It is therefore imperative to act quickly upon receipt of the decision.

### Expertise and Personalized Support
