Obtaining a 10-year resident card is a major objective for many foreigners living in France. This residence permit offers much greater stability than temporary titles and often constitutes a step toward naturalization. Here's what you need to know in 2026.

## What is a Resident Card?

A resident card is a residence permit with a duration of **10 years renewable**. It allows you to live and work in France without having to renew your title annually. It also offers increased protection against removal from territory.

## Different Access Routes

### 1. By Length of Regular Stay

You can request a resident card if you have resided in France in a regular and uninterrupted manner for **at least 5 years**. This condition is the most common.

**Additional Conditions:**

- Justify republican integration (French proficiency and respect for values of the Republic)
- Have stable and sufficient resources
- Not constitute a threat to public order

### 2. By Family Links

Several family situations allow you to directly obtain a resident card:

- **Spouse of French national**: after 3 years of marriage (1 year if you have a French child)
- **Parent of French child**: if you effectively contribute to the maintenance and education of the child since birth or for at least 2 years
- **Ascendant of French national**: if you are dependent on your French child

### 3. By International Protection

Refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection can obtain a resident card after a few years of regular stay in France.

### 4. By Skills and Talents

Certain profiles can benefit from facilitated access:

- "Talent passport" card for 4 years renewable as resident card
- Recognized scientists, researchers, artists

## Integration Criteria in 2026

Republican integration has become a central criterion. You must demonstrate:

**1. French Language Proficiency**

- Minimum A2 level orally and in writing
- French diploma or recognized certification (DELF, TCF)

**2. Knowledge of Republican Values**

- Respect for principles of the Republic
- Adherence to democratic French values

**3. Professional and Social Integration**

- Stable employment or sufficient resources (at least minimum wage)
- Absence of criminal convictions
- Participation in local life (associations, activities)

## Documents to Provide

To assemble a solid file, prepare:

- Valid residence permit
- Proofs of residence in France (last 5 years)
- Pay stubs or tax return
- French language level attestation (DELF A2 or higher)
- Recent proof of address
- Criminal record extract
- OFII medical certificate
- Compliant identity photos

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Not Anticipating Early Enough

The application can take 6 to 12 months. Start your file **at least 6 months** before expiration of your current title.

### Underestimating French Level

A2 level is not negligible. If you have doubts, take an official certification to prove your level.

### Neglecting Continuity of Stay

Absences from France can compromise the condition of 5 years continuous residence. In principle, you should not be absent more than 6 consecutive months.

### Forgetting to Prove Integration

Beyond administrative documents, assemble a file showing your involvement in French society: association attestations, testimonials, evidence of social activities.

## What to Do in Case of Refusal?

A refusal of resident card must be motivated. The most frequent reasons are:

- Insufficient resources
- Insufficient French level
- Threat to public order
- Fraud or false statements

**Possible Recourse:**

1. Gracious recourse with the prefect (2 months)
2. Contentious appeal before the administrative court (2 months)
3. Possibility of requesting a temporary residence permit while waiting

## Benefits of the Resident Card

- **Stability**: title valid for 10 years
- **Professional freedom**: right to exercise any salaried or self-employed activity
- **Protection from removal**: withdrawal difficult, only for serious reasons
- **Mobility**: facilitates travel within Schengen area
- **Toward Naturalization**: after 5 years of resident card, you can request French nationality

## Conclusion

The 10-year resident card represents an important objective in your integration journey in France. The key to success lies in meticulous preparation, complete documents, and clear demonstration of your republican integration.
