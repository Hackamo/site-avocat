You have completed your studies in France and wish to stay to work? The transition from student status to employee status is a delicate but perfectly achievable step. Here is the complete guide to successfully changing your status in 2026.

## Understanding Status Change

A status change means that you move from a student residence permit to an employee or temporary worker residence permit. This is different from a simple renewal: you must prove that you meet the conditions of a new status.

## Conditions to Fulfill

### 1. Having Completed Your Studies

You must have obtained your diploma. Eligible diplomas are:

- Bachelor's degree (Bac+3)
- Master's degree (Bac+5)
- Engineering diploma
- Doctorate
- Professionally recognized diploma at least Bac+3 level

### 2. Finding Employment Linked to Your Studies

**Crucial Point:** the proposed employment must be in **coherence with your training**. The prefecture will verify that:

- The position corresponds to your qualification level
- The tasks relate to your diploma
- The salary is appropriate (at least 1.5 times minimum wage for recent graduates)

### 3. Respecting Salary Conditions

The minimum required salary varies by diploma:

- **Master's or equivalent**: 1.5 times minimum wage (approximately €2,585 gross/month in 2026)
- **Bachelor's or equivalent**: 1.2 times minimum wage (approximately €2,070 gross/month)
- **Exceptions**: certain shortage sectors may have lower thresholds

## Procedure Step by Step

### Step 1: Find an Employer

Your future employer must agree to:

- Hire you with a permanent or fixed-term contract (minimum 12 months)
- Carry out administrative procedures with you
- Wait for work authorization before you start

**Tip:** favor large companies accustomed to international recruitment.

### Step 2: Prepare the File

You must gather:

- Status change request form
- Valid passport
- Current student residence permit
- Diploma obtained in France
- Employment promise or work contract
- Provisional pay stubs
- Proof of address
- Identity photos

**The Employer Must Provide:**

- Declaration of commitment (CERFA)
- Extract from Business Register less than 3 months old
- Declaration of workforce
- Latest financial statements
- URSSAF vigilance attestation

### Step 3: File the Application

The application is made **2 to 3 months before expiration** of your student title via:

- The prefecture website (appointment scheduling)
- ANEF platform (Digital Administration for Foreigners in France)

**Important:** do not leave France during your file's instruction!

### Step 4: Await Instruction

The instruction period varies:

- On average: 2 to 4 months
- In certain prefectures: up to 6 months
- During this time, you benefit from a receipt authorizing you to work

## The Alternative: APS (Provisional Authorization for Stay)

If you just obtained your diploma but haven't found employment yet, request an **APS graduate**. It gives you:

- 12 additional months to search for employment
- Right to work (part-time or full-time)
- Ability to create your business

**Conditions:**

- Master's or equivalent minimum
- Application within 4 months of diploma obtainment
- No resource conditions

## Most Common Refusal Reasons

### 1. Employment/Training Inconsistency

The proposed employment doesn't correspond to your level or field of studies.

**Solution:** prioritize offers directly linked to your training. In case of doubt, ask a lawyer's opinion.

### 2. Insufficient Salary

The offered salary is below the required threshold.

**Solution:** negotiate with the employer to reach the legal minimum. Include bonuses and benefits in the calculation.

### 3. Incomplete File

Documents are missing or outdated.

**Solution:** carefully check the required documents list and anticipate obtaining delays.

### 4. Employment Situation

In certain cases, the prefecture may refuse if it believes French or European candidates could fill the position.

**Solution:** choose occupations in shortage or highly specialized positions.

## Special Cases

### You Have Obtained a Doctorate

With a doctorate, you can directly request a **"talent passport - researcher" card** valid for 4 years. Procedures are simplified.

### You Create Your Business

With a master's minimum, you can create your business and request an "entrepreneur/liberal professional" title. You must present a viable project and have sufficient resources.

### You Are in a Couple

If your spouse is French or holds a residence permit, mention it in your file: this can be a favorable element.

## Practical Tips to Maximize Your Chances

1. **Anticipate**: begin your procedures 3-4 months before expiration of your student title
2. **Care for the employment promise**: it must precisely mention the tasks, salary, duration
3. **Prepare an argument**: write an explanatory letter showing the link between your studies and the job
4. **Keep all justifications**: grade transcripts, internship attestations, letters of recommendation
5. **Remain available**: the prefecture may request additional documents

## What to Do in Case of Refusal?

A status change refusal can be contested:

1. **Gracious recourse**: ask the prefecture to re-examine your file (2 months)
2. **Contentious recourse**: appeal to the administrative court (2 months)
3. **New application**: if the refusal reason is easily correctable

**Important:** have yourself accompanied by a specialized lawyer to maximize your chances of success in appeal.

## Benefits of Employee Title

Once obtained, the employee residence permit offers:

- Duration: 1 to 4 years depending on cases
- Right to work for any employer in your field
- Possibility of renewal then request for resident card (10 years)
- Path to naturalization after 5 years

## Conclusion

The transition from student status to employee status requires preparation and rigor. With a complete file and employment in line with your training, your chances of success are excellent. Don't hesitate to consult a specialized lawyer to secure your procedure.
