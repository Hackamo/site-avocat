# Complete Guide: Regularization, Renewal, and Status Change

## Introduction

You are in France and wish to regularize your situation, renew your residence permit, or change status? These administrative procedures are complex and require perfect knowledge of immigration law. Master Martinet guides you through all the steps.

## 📋 Regularization Through Work

### Conditions to Fulfill

To obtain regularization through work, you must justify:

- **Length of stay in France** of at least 5 years (3 years for parents of schoolchildren)
- **Employment promise or work contract** in a so-called "shortage" occupation
- **Republican integration** (French language proficiency, respect for values of the Republic)
- **Absence of threat to public order**

### Occupations in Shortage

Certain sectors are actively recruiting and facilitate regularization:

- Building and civil works
- Hospitality and catering
- Services to individuals
- Agriculture
- Commerce and sales

### The File to Constitute

A regularization file must be complete and solidly argued:

- Residence permit application form
- Identity and address proofs
- Evidence of presence in France (receipts, invoices, attestations)
- Employment promise with training commitment if necessary
- Favorable opinion from DREETS (formerly DIRECCTE)
- Integration justifications (diplomas, training attestations, volunteering)
- Attestations from known and honorably known persons

## 🔄 Residence Permit Renewal

### Anticipate the Application

The renewal application must be filed **at least 2 months before expiration** of the current title. Delay can result in a period of irregular stay.

### Required Documents

- Current valid residence permit
- Updated proof of resources
- New employment contract or employer attestation
- Recent proof of address
- Compliant identity photos
- Tax stamps

### Special Cases

#### Change of Situation

If your situation has changed (marriage, birth, job loss), additional documents will be necessary.

#### Renewal Refused

In case of refusal, you have **2 months** to contest the decision. Martinet Law Firm assists you in this appeal procedure.

## 🎯 Status Change

### What is a Status Change?

Status change consists of moving from one residence permit to another due to an evolution in your personal or professional situation.

### Main Status Changes

#### From Visitor to Employee

If you entered with a long-stay visitor visa and have found employment, you can request a status change. Conditions:

- Employment promise in an occupation in shortage
- Favorable opinion from DREETS
- Sufficient resources
- Proven integration

#### From Student to Employee

After your studies in France, you can obtain an employee title if:

- You obtained at minimum a Master's degree or equivalent
- Your job corresponds to your training
- The salary is at least equal to 2,080 times the minimum hourly wage
- The employer justifies not having found a candidate on the European job market

#### Status Change for Private and Family Life

If you live as a couple with a French or European national, or if you have family links in France, you can request a "private and family life" card.

### Procedures and Timeline

Status change is a lengthy procedure (6 to 12 months on average). It is imperative to prepare the file carefully from the start to avoid refusals.

## ⚖️ Recourse in Case of Refusal

### Refusal of Regularization or Renewal

If the prefecture refuses your application, you have several options:

1. **Gracious recourse**: ask the prefecture to re-examine your file
2. **Hierarchical recourse**: appeal to the Ministry of Interior
3. **Contentious recourse**: appeal to the administrative court

### Refusal of Status Change

The refusal must be motivated. If the reasons invoked are incorrect, an appeal before the administrative court can result in cancellation of the decision.
